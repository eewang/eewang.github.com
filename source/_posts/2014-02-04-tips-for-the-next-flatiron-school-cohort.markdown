Monday was the first day of the current <a href="http://flatironschool.com" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a> cohort. The day after the Super Bowl holds special resonance in my heart, because it was one year ago to the day that I started at Flatiron. I had been plodding along in my coding journey until that point, when I started on a hockey-stick growth curve that landed me to where I am today at the NYTimes.

In light of that, I felt it apropos to jot down some thoughts and pointers that guided me through my time at Flatiron. Hopefully, current and prospective students at Flatiron (or any other development school, for that matter) can find this list helpful.

*Code each day, but don't just code all day*

As a new developer, its tempting to dive right into code each and every day. While that impulse is great and needs to be cultivated, don't deprive yourself of the learning potential that resources like books, podcasts or code reviews can provide. Coding is obviously a skillset that requires considerable effort actually coding, but being a developer is more than just coding. Avi often told us that coding is simply the most basic part of being a developer. Can you code? Great, but that doesn't mean you can work well in a team or sit across from and negotiation with business users. Professional developers are professional problem solvers, often solving problems defined and experienced by non-developers.

Coding each day helps build a habit of using every new day as an opportunity to cultivate a complex skill set. Even if you're busy with other, non-code things one day, simply firing up your terminal, cleaning up a few bugs, or even just renaming some files via the command line can help new developers build muscle memory that will be invaluable as a professional developer.

*Have a project that you can iteratively build on*

When I started at Flatiron, I set a goal for myself to have a project that would follow me and help me track my progress throughout the class. That project ended up being <a href="https://github.com/eewang/ticket_tracker" target="_blank">TicketTracker</a> - a hacky tool to track ticket prices via the Stubhub API. Looking back, I'm somewhat embarrased by the code, but that doesn't matter. What mattered was that TicketTracker was a project that started out with a simple scraper, then progressed over time to persist data via embedded SQL statements, to a basic Sinatra app with a DataMapper ORM and finally to a full-fledged ActiveRecord Rails app. And all along the way, I tried adding more front-end goodies so that I could practice my HTML / CSS / Javascript. 

Working on the project was erratic, stumbling and repetitive, but, ultimately, tremendously beneficial for me to understand how all the pieces fit together. I didn't care that I had to essentially rewrite the code base each time we learned a new framework or set of coding tools; in fact, having to rewrite the code multiple times helped me learn from my mistakes and realize how to better approach problems in code. Being able to erase code is an under-appreciated skill relative to writing code, but its critical to not stay attached to broken or poorly-written code. If you do, you're only setting yourself up for failure once you get to a professional work environment where prototyping, pivoting and basically tossing away code is common practice.

*Seek to understand the abstraction, not just the implementation*

*Ruby != Rails*

*Code != Ruby*

*Software development != Code*
