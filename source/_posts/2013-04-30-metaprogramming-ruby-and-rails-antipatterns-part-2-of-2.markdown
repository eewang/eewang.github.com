I recently finished reading Rails Antipatterns, which is a great book that uses commonly abused patterns in Rails to illustrate refactoring opportunities. I recommend the book   as a way to improve your "code smell"

Rails Antipatterns

Using view helpers

Use callback macros

Respond_to vs. respond_with

Managing 3rd party service calls (e.g., APIs)
  - Use error logging and rescue unexpected errors
  - Use background job processing services like Sidekiq
  - Use exception notification services like Exception Notifier
