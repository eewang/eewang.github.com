At the NYTimes, I've been fortunate to get exposure to the newsroom via the editorial team that I work with. As we're seeking to build a news platform for the mobile age, we often use actual news stories as use cases for our admin site and consumer app platform. And in the past 5 months, I've been struck by how several of the major news stories pulsating through the industry have been centered around technology. I'm talking, of course, about the ongoing NSA spying story initiated by former NSA staffer Edward Snowden and the botched rollout of the new Healthcare.gov website.

What's interesting to me is not that these topics are major stories in the popular press - the government's role in securing our nation and regulating marketplaces for social services like healthcare has long been a common theme in the media - but that they are so dependent on technical details that often seem lost in our national conversation. 

Take the healthcare.gov site. I can't remember a time before this past October when a sitting president apologized for a broken web application. While complexities in setting up a site that has both a robust user-facing interface and a hefty price calculation engine that has to communicate with multiple external insurance data providers are vast in their own right, the site is made all the more complicated by its national exposure and role as a potential political bludgeon. The typical process for rolling out a large web app - A/B testing, an iterative development process informed by a tight user feedback loop - doesn't seem to have been possible in such a partisan political environment. 

All this goes to say that I believe we need more political leaders that are technically saavy. Its no surprise that the plurality of Congress have a legal background (45% in the Senate and ~30% in the House per [this graphic](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-10/the-113th-congress-by-the-numbers), and very few - if any - have backgrounds in technology or software. Yet Healthcare.gov and the NSA's surveillance program are heavily technical subjects, and the determination of how to proceed properly in the best interest of America depends on a nuanced understanding of the details. And while those serving in Congress are undoubtedly smart (for the most part) people who have to quickly learn about topics as varied as food stamps and Iran's nuclear program, I can't help but think that having a technical foundation would contribute to a more nuanced understanding for the Healthcare site and NSA surveillance program.

For example, the media has been trying to grapple with what the revelations about the NSA surveillance program means for everyday people (the NYTimes and Guardian have created this [video](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/opinion/why-care-about-the-nsa.html?_r=0) and [interactive piece](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded), respectively)
