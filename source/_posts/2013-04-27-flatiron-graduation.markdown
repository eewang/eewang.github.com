Yesterday was the final day of the Flatiron School semester. I'll write a longer blog post hopefully next week with my reflections and thoughts on the 3 month program, but I just wanted to say that its been an awesome experience. I've met some amazing people and I'm so happy to have a skill set now that I can continue to cultivate for the rest of my life. I used to have a lot of ideas for applications or programs that could never reach fruition without knowing how to code; now, I can have an idea and write a simple exploratory Rails app or script to see if its feasible. The skill of being able to ideate and execute simultaneously is a true blessing, and I'm thankful to have had the opportunity to build it at the Flatiron School.

Despite the end of the program, I have no plans to slow down. Sure, I'll be heading back to Chicago next weekend for about 5 days, but I plan to keep coding whenever I'm not hanging out with friends and family. I'll still keep going into school to code with others. I'll still keep blogging about what I'm learning and building. I'll still keep reading coding books and working on Project Euler problems. In many ways, the end of Flatiron just means that I'll have more flexibility during the day to grab coffee or a longer lunch; I don't expect the learning process to decelerate. 

Oh, and looking for jobs. That process will start imminently. While I don't exactly relish the idea of the job search process, it will be a great opportunity for me to meet people in the tech community and learn about what cool stuff companies in New York are building. And if you know of somewhere that looks interesting or someone you think I should meet, feel free to shoot me an e-mail (eugene.wang.77@gmail.com)!
