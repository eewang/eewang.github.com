Coding is not rocket surgery. Discuss.

If you can communicate, you can code. If I wanted to ask someone to get me a sandwich, I could just ask "Hey, can you make me a peanut butter sandwich?" Humans are great at understanding that command. However, computers need to be told exactly what to do. Coding is essentially giving instructions in a very clear, organized and efficient manner. To instruct a computer to make a sandwich, I'd have to write code that breaks down a seemingly simple action into the following commands:

<!--more-->

- Walk to the kitchen
- Open the cupboard
- Take out plate
- Put plate down on kitchen counter
- Take out bread, peanut butter and jelly
- Put ingredients on plate
- Open drawer
- Take out knife
...
- Walk back with sandwich

Humans are great at inferring context and efficiently processing a command like "Make a peanut butter sandwich." Computers, on the other hand, need to be told what to do. However, computers are great at repetition and executing the same instruction set over and over again, in other words, they don't get tired like humans. Thus, computer science is more like the study of operations, and the purpose of coding is to automate processes and operational procedures so that humans can be freed to do what they do best - be creative and make complex decisions.

Its ironic that developers have a stereotype of being inept communicators, since they have to great at communicating instructions to computers.
