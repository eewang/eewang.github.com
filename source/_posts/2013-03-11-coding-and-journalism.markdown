Even though I'm currently studying to be a web developer, my first professional career path was in journalism. 

And even though I don't think I'll be a "traditional" journalist, I still find the field fascinating and absolutely necessary for a vibrant, accountable democracy.

<strong>1) Its about communication</strong>

<strong>2) Data is king</strong>

Much of coding is about taking data, manipulating it and presenting it. At the end of the day, new start-ups or applications seem to mash together data sets or come up with cool new ways of analyzing or presenting data. In fact, one of the bedrock assumptions about coding in Ruby (and I presume in other languages as well) is the concept of duck typing (***REVIEW***), namely that the same "piece" of data can be structured in many different ways, each with its own set of unique methods and way of relating with other objects. For example, "1", [1], 1 and {:number => 1} are all four different pieces of data, even if to humans it all means the number 1. [1] has different functionality as an array than the string, "1". This fact is part of what makes playing with APIs and coding in general so fun, that developers can take data, cut it up, restructure it and present it in a unique way that people hadn't considered before. This makes data so critical when building applications - think about how boring Facebook would be without the wall posts, events, images, etc.

Journalism shares a similar reliance on data. The best articles are oftentimes underpinned by strong datasets

Look at recent Pulitzer Prize winning articles and see which ones used data to underpin their reporting.

<strong>3) Uncovering the bullshit</strong>

"The whole world shines shit and calls it gold."

<strong>4) Process matters</strong>

Journalism examines institutions, developers examine processes and operations.

<strong>5) Both enhance transparency and encourage engagement</strong>

<strong>6) Empathy is critical</strong>

One tidbit of wisdom that Avi mentioned a few weeks back that really stuck with me is that one of the most important traits of a good developer is empathy. Quality developers understand problems and can feel the pain that an inefficient process or broken institution can create.

The New York Times development team is awesome. The guy who created Backbone.js works at the NYT. They're exploring new ways to tell stories, like this super cool story package about a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek" target="_blank">disastrous avalanche</a>.
