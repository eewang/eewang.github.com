    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I begin the fifth week of Flatiron School, I'm feeling pretty good about where things stand. I've been challenged, frustrated and exhausted throughout the previous month, but its been an amazing experience, as I've learned more in the past four weeks than I have since college (and probably before college). The workload has been heavy, and I've been trying to take on some personal projects on the side. Last week was Rails week, and this week we're starting to explore front-end web development via JavaScript/jQuery.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>We have a guest lecturer this week, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jonathangrover1" target="_blank">Jonathan Grover</a>, who is a front-end specialist. I've been working on a few Rails projects that look pretty bare bones at the moment, so it will be great to add some stylings and a dynamic user interface to the apps. Although this week is front-end focused, I hope to keep learning Rails - both during work time in class and after class - through online tutorials and working on my own projects. Given that I'll likely be working with Rails for the foreseeable future, I really want to be fluent in the framework.</p>

<p>Learning Rails last week was challenging, especially to start, since so much of the Rails application building process seems to go on beyond the view of the programmer. Simply starting a new Rails app creates numerous directories and stub files, which can be intimidating to new developers like myself. Compared to Rails, Django starts programmers off with much less scaffolding and support. Django also seems more transparent, as there don't seem to be nearly as many helper methods as in Rails. I can see the benefits of working with both frameworks - it was easier for me to grasp what Django was doing when I first starting using it, but I can definitely see how Rails enables rapid prototyping and efficient development of new apps.</p>

<p>As we enter the second month of the Flatiron program, one of my classmates raised the question of jobs and careers post-Flatiron last Friday. Avi mentioned that its probably still too early to think too much about jobs, and I tend to agree with him. I'm focused right now on building a skill set - learning as much as I can and knowing how to create products. But I'd be lying if I said that the thought of what will happen post-Flatiron hasn't crossed my mind. I've realized that long term, I'd like to use technology and coding as the lens through which I explore and learn about other industries and professions. All professions and industries have processes and data, some common across industries and some idiosyncratic to specific sectors. I think many of the shared processes have been addressed using technology - e.g., e-mail, scheduling software, project management, note-taking - but many of the idiosyncratic ones have not. Certain industries like tech or consumer goods have had their idiosyncratic data and processes transformed by technology, but other industries have not - e.g., energy is one that comes to mind. I'm hoping to use technology to explore the data and processes of all industries.</p>

<p>Another thing that I've realized through the program is that balance is critical. Not just work-life balance but even work-work balance. This past week, I spent one night coding until 3:00 am - most of the hours post-midnight were spent in frustration trying to debug a Sinatra app. I hope that I don't get into a habit of coding so late into the night. Avi mentioned that you shouldn't code for more than 8 hours a day - if you want to keep working after 8 hours, then do some reading, or blogging, or talk to someone about coding. There are ways to keep learning and engaging without actually coding. After hours, read a book or write a blog post. Approaching the same subject in different ways will only help solidify and deepen your understanding. It will help your understanding coalesce more effectively and the mental connections between different technologies to strengthen. While its easy for me to focus on something I enjoy doing, I need to know when to stop so that I don't get burnt out or lose efficiency.</p>

    <link href="http://eewang.github.com/blog/2013/02/11/5-reasons-everyone-should-learn-how-to-code/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-11T18:33:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://eewang.github.com/blog/2013/02/11/5-reasons-everyone-should-learn-how-to-code</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You should learn how to code. Even if you don't want to be a programmer, coding is the new literacy. Don't worry if you don't have a technical background and never touched code in your life. I came to Flatiron having only taken one programming course ever. I worried that I was too old to learn this stuff; it seemed like everyone was either a computer science major or had been coding since they were kids. However, I've learned that the technology has become much more accessible to beginners in the past few years.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>And at the end of the day, computers are just tools that were built by humans. And while the subject matter isn't easy, its not as mystical or obscure as I had initially thought. At the risk of sounding cliche, its never too late to learn a new skill. Here are five reasons why everyone (including you!) should learn how to code.</p>

<p><strong>1) Be Productive and Have an Impact</strong></p>

<p>Coding is a cheap way to be a maker and creator and to connect with the world around you. Its exhilirating to write some code, start your browser and instantly see what you wrote intepreted on screen. I can't think of many industries where you can immediately see the fruits of your labor. Coming from asset management, I found it difficult to connect my work back to the end beneficiary - retirees, teachers, etc. - as there seemed to be multiple layers of intermediation such that I couldn't see the full impact I was having. With web development, its easier to get immediate gratification from your work.</p>

<p>Coding also enables you to have an outsized impact. Everyone's heard how Facebook, Google, etc. grew out of a college dorm room or garage and are now changing the world in tangible ways. While those home run endeavors are few and far between, its empowering to think that I can create something in a short amount of time and instantly let anyone with Internet access see what I've done. Even in launching this blog, I love the fact that my writing could have an impact on people that I've never even met. Programming opens up a whole new method of communicating and expressing ideas that I had never imagined. For many years, I was just a consumer of the Internet - reading blogs, using applications and playing games. Learning how to code is the first step to becoming a productive member of a modern, Web-enabled society and contributing back to the complex system of tubes that has provided me countless hours of enjoyment and learning.</p>

<p><strong>2) Use Your Entire Brain</strong></p>

<p>Its rare to find an activity that engages both your left brain and right brain as actively as web development. Good, modern web applications are both well designed and analytically powerful programs. When I worked as a editor in charge of layout and design at my college newspaper, I had to think creatively about how to display content - what colors, fonts and page structure would attract readers yet not diminish the written content? In finance, I had to move to the other side of the intellectual spectrum and think much more analytically, use data and solve problems in a structured, deliberate manner. I have found web development to be the best of both worlds - a field that tightly integrates the creative with the analytical in such a way that brings people with varied and diverse skill sets to the same table.</p>

<p><strong>3) Build A Valuable Skill Set</strong></p>

<p>Technology is booming, and good developers are in high demand. I've heard from people in the industry that its not uncommon for start-ups to have high turnover - not because of job dissatisfaction, but rather because there are so many good opportunities out there that developers are able to move around to satisfy their desire to work on new, interesting problems. As technology continues to disrupt industries and economies - just look at how Amazon has transformed the consumer market - companies moving this tidal wave of transformation forward will be eagerly seeking out talented people who are able to understand technology and apply it to business problems. And while consumer-oriented industries like fashion or marketing have already been upended by technology, I'm convinced that the best is still to come for more defensive industries like energy, transportation and healthcare. Even when working in finance, I clearly saw how powerful technology can enhance a company's product strategy and give them a leg up on their competition. This trend toward digitization and the application of technology in process and operations isn't going away anytime soon - might as well get on the leading edge by learning how to code.</p>

<p><strong>4) Work With Passionate People</strong></p>

<p>One thing I learned about myself from working at my college newspaper was that I love working with passionate people. I draw energy from them, and it makes whatever work I'm doing more palatable. In the interactions I've had with entrepreneurs and people at start-ups, its clear to me that developers, designers and the start-up community in general are incredibly passionate about what they do. In fact, you pretty much have to be passionate to start a company, since its easier to get a job at a large company than to venture out on your own. When I talk to people who work in this field, I can just hear in their voice how excited they are to have an impact and execute on an idea.</p>

<p>A great example of the passion technologists have for their craft are hackathons. In New York City, you can probably find a hackathon on any given weekend - I have a friend who goes to a few hackathons a month. The simple fact that these exist is a testament to passion; developers are willing to spend an entire Saturday coding and hacking away at a single problem. They are there because they are excited about solving problems and want to think creatively about how to improve the world around them. I've been to two hackathons, one about energy and the environment and the other about music. However, in the past month alone, I've heard about hackathons covering fashion, education and sanitation. There's a hackathon in a few months for government and civic institutions. The people going to these hackathons are not going for the money (although some do offer cash prizes); they're attending because they're passionate.</p>

<p><strong>5) Enjoy a Lifetime of Learning</strong></p>

<p>When you first begin to explore technology, you'll quickly learn (as I did) how much there is out there to learn. Each concept I learned about opened the door to 10 more concepts. Technology is a very, very long rabbit hole, but once you get started, you'll never run out of concepts to explore, in large part because its such a dynamic and fast-growing field. Each year, developers produce new frameworks and new languages; in fact, Ruby itself is only two decades old, and didn't really catch fire until the mid-2000s. The scope of technology is increasing faster than I can learn new skills.</p>

<p>In addition to learning Ruby and web development, I'm interested in exploring design, writing iOS applications and creating data visualizations. Obviously, I won't be able to tackle all of those goals in the 12-week Flatiron program. But learning how to code is the bedrock foundation for really understanding technology, so I'm excited to take what I'm learning here and extending that over and over again in the future as I continue my education.</p>

<hr />

<p>I hope those 5 reasons provide enough motivation to start the lifelong journey of learning how to use technology as a tool through code. If you're a developer or learning how to program, what made you first want to code? What were some of the difficulties in getting started? If you don't have any interest in coding, why not? I don't think everyone is meant to be a programmer, but there are certainly misconceptions and assumptions about coding that cause people to establish mental obstacles to actually trying to learn, and I'd like to hear what people think.</p>

    <link href="http://eewang.github.com/blog/2013/02/10/flatiron-week-1-redux/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-10T14:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://eewang.github.com/blog/2013/02/10/flatiron-week-1-redux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Flatiron is now 1/12 the way done. The first week has been pretty great; after lecture on Friday I felt physically exhausted, but mentally I was running a mile a minute, thinking of all the stuff that's out there to learn. My schedule has generally been to get into school around 9 am, morning lecture, lunch, afternoon lecture, group work, then wrap up around 6 pm, after which I'll stay until 7:30/8:00. I realize that it's only been one week, but I've already learned a ton.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Here are a few of my high-level thoughts on how the first week went:</p>

<p><strong>1) The interwebs are awesome</strong></p>

<p>The Internet is essentially the largest, most secure and most accessible library humans have ever known is available largely for free. If you take a step back and think about it, you'll realize how remarkable that is. The fact that I can search, communicate, schedule and manage my life using Google's services and products without paying them is amazing. I'll pay more today for a cup of coffee than I have ever paid Google, despite the fact that I depend on Google to manage my e-mail, calendar and data. And while I'm fully cognizant of the fact that "if you're not paying for it, you're the product," I'd rather have it that way than for the Internet to be only accessible to people with money. If I can rely on advertisers and data providers to subsidize my learning and exploration, I'm more or less okay with that.</p>

<p><strong>2) "Coding is not rocket surgery"</strong></p>

<p>Computers tend to be perceived as magical black boxes. You click on an browser icon, type in a URL and bam, you have the world's information at your fingertips. But in actuality, computers aren't that smart - they're just really good at following instructions and doing the same thing over and over again. On the other hand, humans are great at inferring context, understanding nuance and efficiently processing a statement like "Do you mind making me a sandwich?" - which is actually a subtle command in the form of a question. Computers, on the other hand, need to be told exactly what to do. However, computers, unlike humans, don't get tired. Thus, computer science is more like the study of operations, and the purpose of coding is to automate processes and operational procedures so that humans can be freed to do what they do best - be creative and make complex decisions.</p>

<p>This means that to be able to tell a computer what to do (i.e., be a programmer), you need to just be very good at communicating a specific set of instructions. And once you take a look under the hood of a computer (my recommendation would be to start using your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X)" target="_blank">terminal</a> to access files and applications), you'll realize as I've realized that programs are created by people and can be understood so long as you put in the time and effort to read through the program instructions and follow the logic tree. Avi captured this well by claiming that "coding is not rocket surgery" - not to diminish the challenge of learning how to code, but rather to demystify the process and encourage beginners to overcome the mental barrier of understanding computers not as objects of frustration but as tools to be used.</p>

<p><strong>3) There is so much out there to learn</strong></p>

<p>A good chunk of the first week was spent working on our student profiles, setting up our blogs and generally getting acquainted with the school and day-to-day schedule. In terms of subject matter, we covered the following topics this week:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Git/GitHub</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Environment set-up</li>
  <li>Basic HTML/CSS</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these topics can get pretty in depth in their own right. We've just scratched the surface on Ruby, for example. But as I've found in learning most anything, the more you explore, the more you find to explore. Like going down a rabbit hole, we're just getting started.</p>

<p><strong>4) Some pretty cool people are learning to code</strong></p>

<p>I've met a bunch of awesome people in class (including our <a href="http://shitavisays.tumblr.com" target="_blank">great instructor</a>). The backgrounds of the students are pretty diverse. In addition to the people working in finance or professional services before starting Flatiron (myself included, this is New York, after all), there are people who worked as designers, entrepreneurs, teachers - we even a professional poker player in class. This diversity of professional background makes for interesting conversations, and its been great to talk to my classmates about what interests them and for how they hope to use technology to better pursue their passions. I used to think that my career options were binary - either pursue technology or explore my passion for media, education and public policy. Instead, I've realized that technology doesn't supplant my passions; technology complements and enhances my passions.</p>

<p><strong>5) This stuff is fun</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the day, programming should be fun and enjoyable. Coding is much more about creative expression than I had imagined before; after all, Matz created Ruby to make developers <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/rubyP.html" target="_blank">happy</a>. My first exposure to computers and technology was through my parents, who worked as engineers for a large telecom company for many years. Watching them, I never considered technology to be a creative endeavor - it seemed like much more of a 9 to 5 job than I've come to realize. Since moving to New York though, its become clear to me that people in the tech sphere tend to be intellectually and creatively engaged with their craft, even to the point of "working" well beyond the daytime hours and into the weekends. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank">Hackathons</a> are great examples of this. The whole concept of a hackathon - an intensive, focused effort to solve a problem that brings together developers, designers and subject matter experts - is to engage in creative problem solving, not to follow a rote set of instructions. Not only are hackathons indicative of passion people in technology have for their craft, its also an expression of community - a desire to work together with people of different skill sets toward a single goal.</p>

<p>Flatiron has tried to imbue in us a sense of community, that programmers work better together than apart. Coding used to be an endeavor that people would do in their basements, alone, late at night. But it doesn't have to be this way. In fact, its much more enjoyable to code and program in a community of people so you can bounce ideas off of them, explore new technologies and learn from each other. For me, this was one of the most appealing aspects of doing an intensive, full-time program like Flatiron as opposed to learning in isolation. For the latter half of 2012, I was trying to learn this stuff on my own - using online tools like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, <a href="http://www.udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity</a> and <a href="http://www.codeschool.com" target="_blank">Code School</a>. All of those tools were great, but its challenging, frustrating and, frankly, kind of boring, to learn coding entirely on your own, especially if you have a full-time (and then some) job as I did. Thankfully, I had my brother to mentor me and help me along when I hit a roadbump, as he was busy building <a href="http://www.leaguevine.com/" target="_blank">Leaguevine</a> at the time. I've found that learning in a focused group environment like at Flatiron School to not only be more fun, but also more efficient; before it might take me a whole afternoon and a whole lot of Stack Overflow-ing to debug a few lines of code, now I can easily ask others for help, which allows me to fix problems more quickly and learn more about what I'm doing in the process.</p>

    <link href="http://eewang.github.com/blog/2013/02/08/flatiron-day-005/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-08T23:44:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://eewang.github.com/blog/2013/02/08/flatiron-day-005</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In grade school, snow days meant building snowmen, tossing snow balls and going sledding. At the Flatiron School, snow days mean 6 hours of lecture via video conference. Avi and Co "cancelled" class today in advance of Snowmageddon 2013, but only in the sense that we weren't expected to physically be in class. Instead, Avi set up a videoconference and hosted virtual class where we continued exploring Ruby.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>We covered a range of topics today. Starting with a review of our homework, Avi discussed iteration, arrays, string methods, regular expressions, symbols, variable scope, blocks and hashes. Whew! We went through a lot of material today, but I think I'm grasping everything decently well. Its been pretty interesting to think about how there always seems to be more than one way of doing something in Ruby.</p>

<p>A good example of that was the homework we had last night. We had to write a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz" target="_blank">FizzBuzz</a> program and extend that to find all numbers that fizz, buzz or fizzbuzz within a range. I've posted my code below. What's amazed me about coding, though, is that there are <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/FizzBuzz" target="_blank">countless</a> ways of doing the same thing, both within and across languages. For example, the "trick" to FizzBuzz is to recognize that Fizz and Buzz combine to make FizzBuzz. This means that my code below, while it gets the job done, is not the most efficient and probaly not up to best practices. I have three strings for the three results, but in fact I should only have two strings - Fizz and Buzz, which combine to make FizzBuzz.</p>

<p>Avi showed us a bunch of different ways to code the FizzBuzz problem, and if there's a ton of different ways to solve the simple FizzBuzz problem, I can only begin to imagine how many infinite paths there are to building more complex applications. That thought is exciting to me; there are many paths out there that haven't yet been explored and technology continues to be a space of great potential for human creativity and ingenuity. When I think back to a year ago, a part of me was resigned to thinking that we've reached the end of the road for technology - we have Google, Facebook and Twitter, what else could be out there? However, now that I've taken a peek under the hood of the web and seen a glimpse of what is possible, I'm convinced that the best is yet to come. Not just in web development, but in technology more broadly. 3-D printing, Internet-enabled hardware, sensors - the possibilities are limitless for the technology platforms that are only now in their infancy. Its both humbling and exciting to think about.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning, we started with a review of the SQL homework and ventured into the wide world of SQL joins, followed by the start of our Ruby learning in the afternoon. Regarding SQL, I struggled a bit with the homework last night, but after I read up a bit more on joins, the confusion lessened and I was able to create a working quiz database. Our task was to (i) design a database schema, (ii) populate the database, (iii) query the database and (iv) determine quiz scores. I've published the SQL code I wrote to accomplish this task after the jump.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>After a lunch of Chinese food delivered to the school, we delved into Ruby. The "Programmer of the Day" was, aptly enough, Yukihiro Matsumoto, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto" target="_blank">"Matz"</a>, who invented the Ruby language. Avi described how Matz designed Ruby to be pleasing to the people using the language, not for the computer. The ultimate reason for creating Ruby was simply because it made Matz happy - not because of efficiency, power or universality, but rather human happiness. Ruby is a language designed to match the differences and idiosycracies inherent in human behavior and interaction. As Avi put it, our differences should be celebrated, not suppressed, and as a philosophical basis, Ruby enables different programmers to express themselves differently - there's no one right way of doing something.</p>

<p>I enjoy Avi's occasional expositions on the philosophical underpinnnings of code. I had never before thought about coding as an expressive and creative medium, on par with other art forms like music or painting, but the more I think about it, the more I can appreciate how code empowers people to exercise creativity. Even simple functions and programs can be written in any number of different ways. The mere variety of how much can be done using code is a testament to the infinite possibilities available with code.</p>

<p>For the rest of the afternoon, Avi lectured about Ruby and we broke off on occasion to work on practice problems. We covered variables, methods and basic control structures. All of the stuff we covered today was part of the class pre-work, but it was good to solidify my understanding, and I realized that there a few quirks of Ruby that I would have taken for granted if we had just skipped over the basic foundations of Ruby. For example, did you know that if you run a command like:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="kp">true</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>And then try to print the value of x, you won't be returned 3? That's because Ruby, in evaluating the expression, first saw that the left side of the "OR" statement (indicated by ||) was true and so it automatically knew that the entire expression was true (at least one side was true). Thus, Ruby didn't even assign the number 3 to the variable x. I hadn't considered that behavior for Ruby before, so it was good to go through some of the more nuanced aspects of the language.</p>

<p>Learning Ruby took up most of the rest of the day. Tonight, we have to write a few basic programs in Ruby (FizzBuzz!) just to get more acquainted with the language.</p>

<p><em>SQL Exercise</em></p>

<p>This SQL code serves as the database schema and creates five tables - 'users', 'quizzes', 'questions', 'choices' and 'answers'. Each quiz has multiple questions, each of which have multiple choices. Users take quizzes and select choices as their answers, which then populates the 'answers' table.</p>

<p>In creating the database, Avi made a few good points about efficient nomenclature. When I first created my database, I had redundant field names for my tables (e.g., "id" in the "choices" table was labeled "choice_id"). The prefix of "choice" for "id" is redundant, since the inclusion of the field in the "choices" table automatically associates "id" with "choices" and differentiates it from the "id" field in the other tables. Its not a huge deal to include the table prefix in the field name, but its unnecessary and the elimination of the prefix is an example of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).</p>

<p>After creating the schema, we had to write SQL that would populate the database. The below SQL script adds data into the "users", "quizzes", "choices" and "questions" tables. As you'll notice, there are 2 quizzes, each with 5 questions, each with 4 choices, for a total of 40 choices (2 * 5 * 4), hence the number of rows in the "choices" table. I used a "multi-insert" statement here rather than having INSERT INTO ... VALUES surrounding each of my entries. This saves time and makes the code look cleaner. Also, I added the corresponding field names after the table name in each of the insert blocks - I don't think this is necessary, as SQL will read the entries and assume that the first value goes into the first column, labeled "id", and same with the other columns, but I figure that its best practice to be explicit with the field names so that there's no ambiguity (for example, if you add fields in the future).</p>

<p>This SQL command populates the "answers" table with data. I purposefully populated the data such that Derrick Rose got all questions right (he's the best of the 3, after all), Kevin Durant got 3 questions right in each quiz and Lebron got only 1 question right per quiz (I'm still bitter over the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals).</p>

<p>This SQL command analyzes the resulting answers. In designing this query, I wanted to get back a table of six rows - one for each user-quiz pairing for 3 users, each taking 2 quizzes - with the user name, quiz name and total correct answers. I started the "answers" table, as I figured that "answers" would be my primary source for the scores; how could you determine a correct score without knowing the quiz takers' answers?. From there, I joined the table against other tables that included useful information.</p>

<p>The "answers" table includes what each user selected as a choice for a given question, but not whether that choice is correct (including such data in this table would be de-normalizing the "correct answer" data, which lives in the "choices" table), so I joined the "answers" table against "choices" to determine which choices selected by users were correct. Then, I continued joining against "questions", "users" and "quizzes" to get the necessary information. Finally, I grouped the results by user_id and quiz_id, which collapses the return table into the 6 row table for each user-quiz pair that I was looking for.</p>

<p>Avi said that we wouldn't be actively writing many SQL queries, since Rails abstracts so much of the database interaction. However, there will undoubtedly be times when Rails isn't sufficient for complex data queries, and we'll have to write our own SQL. Even if we don't use SQL that often, its critical to know, and I think its pretty cool, despite the at times frustrating syntax and poor debugging feedback for the sqlite3 shell. I would like to eventually explore more advanced data analysis tools, software like Hadoop or Cassandra, so knowing SQL is going to be invaluable moving forward.</p>
